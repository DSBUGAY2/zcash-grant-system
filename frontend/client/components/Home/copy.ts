  requestDescription: `
The Zcash Foundation will periodically open up requests for proposals that
have financial incentives attached to them in the form of fixed bounties,
or pledges of contribution matching.

Proposals will be reviewed and chosen based on the ZFâ€™s confidence in the
team and their plan.

To be eligible for funding from the Zcash Foundation, teams must provide
identifying information for legal reasons.
