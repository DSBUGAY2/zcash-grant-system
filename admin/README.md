# Grant.io Admin UI

This is the admin component of [Grant.io](http://grant.io).

## Development

1. Install local project dependencies:

   ```bash
   # Local dependencies
   yarn
   ```

1. Make sure ganache is running and contracts have been built for the dev network (if frontend dev is running this should be the case).

1. Run the webpack build for the admin ui:

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

1. Open a web browser to localhost:3500.
